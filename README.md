# Gravity-Simulator

Simulate New Amazing Things like Black Hole , New Orbital Patterns & More and Share it me on **twitter @Siddhant_2407**

I thought it would be cool to be able to mess around with gravity and experiment, so I made this simple gravity simulator.

Features
Scientifically accurate (for the most part)
Interactive object placement and deletion
Customizable gravity values and object masses
Tick warping
Hotkeys (G for gravity spot, O for object, and X for delete)
A few notes:

The objects do not collide with each other and instead pass through each other, and the gravity spots are fixed (not influenced by gravity)

Simulation might be a bit buggy on very small screens because of how the scaling works but for the most part it's fine

If you zoom out a ton it's laggy
